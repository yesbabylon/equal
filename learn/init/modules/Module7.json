We found out that we were definitely a target, so we had to assess the size of the threat.    Next we analysed the measures that we already had in place and how much of the threat this covered. Then we looked at the rest of the threat, and determined if it was an acceptable risk.    **HR is the first line of defence**  There is always a risk when hiring new employees. That is why HR is our first line of defence. We trained them to check resumes for inconsistencies. If you know what to look for, this is of an enormous help.",

Sure, it looked good, but where did this person get the time and money to do all this?    **Feedback loop**  We also implemented a feedback loop, where departments discussed who they hired, how the selection procedure had gone and how that correlates to how these employees function now. This proved very valuable and made the whole process much more efficient.    **Training**  The last thing I want to mention here is that we invested in training of security employees in a simple form of profiling. They learned to be more aware of what they see, feel and hear. 'Trust your gut' is what we tell them."

They all had to successfully follow a specific training trajectory.    **Awareness training and reporting line**  To raise more awareness about Insider Threats, we provided an awareness training to all employees. This in-house training emphasised on significant changes in attitudes, statements, clothing or physical appearance of co-workers. If considered important and/or worrying, all employees had the possibility to report their observations via a confidential internal channel."

For example, we had an incident with a long-standing employee who posted explicit pictures and sympathetic comments with regards to certain terrorist organisations on social media.    As an organisation, it is important to not only detect this, but to also act fast. That is why we cannot rely on 'accidental discovery' when it comes to this kind of sudden divergent social media activity. We need a proactive approach.    In most cases, follow-up interviews about these divergent activities clear the aire. When they do not, other measures need to be taken."
