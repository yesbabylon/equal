By matching an employee's observable behaviours with phases along the pathway, investigators can start to gain a sense of how far along the pathway to an attack the employee may be.

Identifying the Insider can feel like 'finding a needle in a stack of needles'.  * The Insider knows the organisation's security measures and therefore knows how to work around them."
