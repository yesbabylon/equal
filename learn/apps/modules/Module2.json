The Doel 4 power turbine had to be shut down urgently. Engie Electrabel assumed immediately that there was sabotage in the game.    The damage to the turbine was so extensive that the nuclear reactor could not be restarted until some 6 months later. A large part of Belgium's electricity production capability had become unavailable. The costs for the repairs amounted to more than €138 million."

He used download tools called scraping software that allowed large numbers of files to be downloaded over slow networks.    It is estimated that Snowden shared between 50.000 and 200.000 classified documents with reporters, of which only a very small percentage have been made public so far.    The disclosures of NSA documents to date represent the 'tip of the iceberg' of more damaging disclosures. The estimated cost of mitigating the damage could reach a roughly estimated $1 billion."

Thousands of files were deleted and systems were sabotaged. Remote control over the systems was disabled for days, sewage pumping stations were turned on whilst valves were closed and error messages were deleted.    The investigation led to a former employee who was using various adminitrator login details and a company laptop, which had gone missing, to actively sabotage the company's systems."

By matching an employee's observable behaviours with phases along this pathway, investigators can start to gain a sense of how far along the pathway to an attack the employee may be.    Motivations, and the observable behaviours associated with them, will vary from person to person, and depending on the employee's individual situation."
